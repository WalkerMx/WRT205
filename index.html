        <p class="center">
            This collection is a showcase of why I, having read the works of many a ‘living’ poet, prefer the works of dead poets. Each work in this collection was specifically selected to illustrate how modern poets have allowed their
            creativity and talent in writing be squandered. The cause for this awful misuse of poetics is not new or rare, and in fact, could be applied to any great works while their authors are still living. We see many great ‘eras’ of
            poetic works coloured (or, biased) by the contemporary events that define the era’s time period. Social events of the times become the backdrop of a creative work. During times of famine or unrest for example, you will find
            those themes defining the writing in that period. Perhaps, in times of inequity and excess, perhaps, you might have found yourself really trying to decide if you could get away with walling that man you don’t particularly like
            into your cellar. Then again, these days, were we to read such a tale, we would simply call it macabre and, even, darkly intriguing. But, I digress. <br />
            <br />
            For each of the following four poems, I will briefly highlight the faults that ruin the enjoyment the work, and elaborate on how this applies not just to that particular work, but also to contemporary works being composed today.
            I will also endeavor to highlight the merits of these works – rather, I’ve selected some fine poems, well written, well composed, and deeply meaningful. It’s easy to hate bad poetry, but my goal today, is to share with you why I
            hate good poetry – why we shouldn’t be able to appreciate the works that are still living, why we don’t have the context to interpret them, and why it’s too early to put any works from our era on the pedestal. <br />

                    An Untitled Poem - Christopher Poindexter<br />
                    <br />
                    This work, is short and sweet. The author, heralded by some as a ‘genius’ concerning poetry, is know for work in this style (a sort of ‘bad typewriter on parchment’) and posting to Instagram.<br />
                    <br />
                    I hate, that this work is done using social media as a platform. It denigrates the work itself, to be shared socially, like a drink, rather than being shared personally, intimately, with the readers. It’s like sharing
                    dainty sips of wine to a boat-full of Vikings – sure, they’ll drink it, but what’s being appreciated is the alcohol and not the character.<br />

                    Someday I'll Love - Ocean Vuong<br />
                    <br />
                    This work does a sort of neato little dance with figurative and creative dance with language. The work is a sort of double entendre, playing on the author’s name. Which is part of why I can’t stand it.<br />
                    <br />
                    This work is clever, and yet, it’s clearly grounded in personal experience. It’s the sort of works that say “Hey, look at me, I need two history professors, a sociologist, and my grief counselor to fully interpret!”
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    The work is no doubt meaningful, and even relatable – but only in part. It feels like a puzzle, who’s picture isn’t blank – it’s TV static.<br />

                    Backwards – Warsan Shire<br />
                    <br />
                    Reading this, it’s hard to not first admire, the sort of thought that went into this piece. It reads to a point, forwards, then the words from each line are repeated in reverse.<br />
                    <br />
                    But, it’s not backwards, it’s Backwards.<br />
                    <br />
                    Despite your first inclination, it’s not a mirror of the poem. The structure, the capitalization, the punctuation, they’re all slightly different. There’s really a sort of nuance, to the two stories it tells.<br />
                    <br />
                    There’s no denying it, it’s just the sort of talent I personally love. It’s vivid and cleaver, so why should I hate it?<br />
                    <br />
                    Because it’s Backwards, not backwards.<br />
                    <br />

                    All the Dead Boys Look Like Me – Loma (Christopher Soto)<br />
                    <br />
                    Here, we find something more socially relevant. This work includes many, many (not so) subtle references to our national scars. Moreso maybe, the author’s scars. The poem is woven, like teeth on a comb, and spaced
                    (unusually) with slashes where new lines would have liked to live.<br />
                    <br />
                    The poem sings of fear, and screams empowerment. And if that were all, I wouldn’t hate it.<br />
                    <br />
                    But the work also calls your attention. Begs for it. Supporting the poem isn’t supporting its ideals, it’s a call for social validation. Which I give gladly, yet, I hate that the author thinks so little of themselves,
                    that they need the validation, to be supported as a person, by we the masses of strangers.<br />
